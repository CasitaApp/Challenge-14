What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing the training window?

Increasing the training windows capture more data however if increasing the windows to much may lead to overfitting and produce to much noise.
Decreasing the training windows use a smaller amount of data for the model training to make it more responsive to market fluctuations however the model may have less exposure to longer term patterns which can result in increase in volatility depends of market conditions.
